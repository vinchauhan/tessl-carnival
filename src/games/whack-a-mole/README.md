# Whack-a-Mole

Whack the moles as they pop up from the nine holes, before they duck back down.

## How to play

- Moles pop up from a 3 by 3 grid of holes, stay up for a moment, then drop back down.
- Click a mole while it's up to whack it.
- The round lasts 30 seconds. Moles pop up more often, and stay up for less
  time, as the clock runs down: from one every 0.9 seconds, up for 1.1 seconds,
  at the start, to one every 0.35 seconds, up for 0.55 seconds, at the end.
- Click again on the game over screen to play another round.

## Scoring

Each whacked mole scores 10 points. A click that misses costs nothing.

Your final score is saved to the carnival's score board when the round ends.

## Files

- `game.ts`: the game logic (`createState`, `step`, `popUp`, `whack`,
  `spawnInterval`, `upTime`) and the `whackAMole` entry, the default export the
  midway finds.
- `game.test.ts`: tests for the game logic.
